                "Taking standardized tests has never been a strength of mine. I always found myself being disappointed
                with my score, falling quite short of my goals consistently. This pattern continued with Step 1. One of
                my friends told me about Ocean Ink and how successful he was on Step 2 after completing the program.
                Using Ocean Ink for my Step 2 studying was the best decision I could have made. Dr. Le Pava did not just
                teach me how to take this test; she helped me get my confidence back. Dr. Le Pava gives her all to her
                students, and her support is unwavering. My score increased 35 points from Step 1 to Step 2. I met my
                goal score and then some. For the first time, I felt that my score reflected how hard I worked. I am so
                grateful to Dr. Le Pava and Ocean Ink and could not thank her enough for what she did for me."

                "I met Dr. Le Pava during what I found to be the lowest point for myself in medical school.
                I had failed COMLEX Level 1. This was the first time I had failed anything in medical school and
                came as a complete shock to me. I was embarrassed, scared, emotionally labile and I thought my
                medical career had come to a dead end. I did not want to take the risk of retaking the exam and
                failing again, so I researched online and went to Champaign, Illinois hoping for a miracle to help
                me because I was broken. I met Dr. Le Pava during my struggle with studying for COMLEX Level 1,
                and she is the only person responsible for all of my successes since then. She was everything to me –
                a teacher, a guru, a friend, my guiding light. She showed me the way, and I followed everything she
                told me like a scripture. She treated me not like a student but like her family. I could not have
                gotten through those four months without her. She worked with me constantly, encouraging me through
                times when I was depressed, scared and didn’t feel like I could go on. She was the only reason I
                regained my confidence and was able to take COMLEX again. My score went up from 390 to 510. I could
                not have gotten through that difficult time and done so well without her. I returned to my rotations
                for third year and the time to take COMLEX PE and COMLEX Level 2 came again. This time I was much more
                confident because I knew what would help me and that was Dr. Le Pava. She worked with me for four months
                online tutoring me for COMLEX Level 2 because I was still on rotations. I followed her system again
                and this time taking the exam was much less scary. I got a score of 540 with her help. I had achieved
                more than I thought I was capable of and it was all because of her. This reinforced in me what an
                amazing teacher and guru can do for you. She has all the pearls anyone needs to succeed. I returned
                to Champaign, Illinois for two weeks because I knew I needed to be in her guidance and her presence
                for taking the COMLEX PE. She worked with me everyday individually for 3-4 hours and taught me how
                to take a perfect history and physical exam. She had me practice cases every day, and we went through
                PE books multiple times. She had me take practice exams on the weekends where she replicated test-like
                conditions and had other actors so I could get used to testing conditions. I was nervous and scared
                due to my past failure, but she had confidence in me. I took the PE after spending two weeks with her
                in Champaign. I recently got my score back, and I passed the COMLEX PE. I had gotten my career back.
                Ever since I practiced for the PE with her I have been getting excellent comments from attendings on
                my rotations about how perfect my history, physical exam and notes are! I had done much better than
                many other classmates. I am writing this testimonial for anyone who is in the position that I was in.
                Dr. Le Pava is the one who can help you. She is the perfect resource for any of the USMLE or
                COMLEX exams. Her knowledge base is vast, and she will care for you like no one else will. She is an
                amazing teacher and she is like family to me. I owe every one of my successes only to her. Thank you,
                Dr. Le Pava; words are not enough to express all that you have done for me."

                "There aren't enough words to express what Ocean Ink, specifically Dr. Le Pava, has done for me.
                I never had testing issues until the Step exams. After struggling with Step 2, I knew that I'd
                need help with preparing for Step 3. It wasn't until I got with Ocean Ink and Dr. Le Pava that
                things really started to "click." I was on a regimented schedule, did multiple blocks of
                questions and had personal tutoring sessions, which helped me feel more immersed in the material,
                improved my understanding, and helped me make connections that I previously hadn't made. Dr. Le Pava's
                dedication and working with me daily--her motivation, tough love and belief in what to me seemed
                impossible--was the driving force that lead to my success. There may be many review courses out
                there that have certain claims, but I speak first-hand on behalf of Ocean Ink and say that this
                is the REAL DEAL! There are no gimmicks, and you will NOT sit for the exam until it's shown and
                proven that you are ready. I fully trusted the process, without hesitation, did what I was
                instructed to do and success followed! I would 100% not be where I am today as a successful physician
                without Dr. Le Pava and Ocean Ink."

                "I had never had test anxiety before med school-I always believed that if I prepared as best as
                I knew how, I would be fine. I think most of us who go into the medical field probably felt this
                way at some point along the way. The USMLE Step exams were a different kettle of fish, and when
                I failed Step 2, there was this sudden overwhelming fear and sense of inadequacy that just washed
                over me. It was paralyzing in many senses because not only do you feel the disappointment that
                comes with failure, you feel this doubt that seeps in wondering if you have been a fraud all
                along and whether or not you will be capable of overcoming this hurdle.<br>
                I’m so glad that God sent Dr. Le Pava my way-I’m not sure where I'd be today without her.
                She believes in her students so much that you wonder why you can't see what she sees in you.
                She helped rebuild and restore confidence, trust the process, maintain focus amid all the doubt
                and soldier on through the tears and despair that come with the preparation. She was there through
                every part of the journey-laughed with me when I needed to find joy, cried with me because she
                had been there and understood the pain, and prayed over me daily as I fought through it.<br>
                Thanks to all this, I managed to pass Step 2, and when I needed to take Step 3, I knew she was
                the only way I was going to get through it. It is a tough journey that had me knocked down
                several times, but through it all, my two constants were God and Dr. Le Pava. I can’t express
                fully how grateful I am that she came my way, that she was patient with me through this all
                and stuck with me in spite of my various shortcomings. I can only say
                "<strong>THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART</strong>” to her and Ocean Ink for all
                that they did for me."

                "I came to know Dr. Le Pava over a long and grueling three months. I was told I would be kicked out of
                medical school if I didn't pass my boards. I had already been a non-traditional student in terms of
                timeline, and I was frightened, hopeless, broken, and everything I shouldn't be when attempting to
                study. I was so embarrassed that I didn't even tell my parents, friends, or family that I was embarking
                on this journey in the middle of the country where I knew no one. For three months, I didn't see a
                single familiar face--I was alone. Initially, I didn't believe that another prep program would help me,
                because really, how are they any different? Little did I know, I was wrong. Not only did Dr. Le Pava
                teach me the knowledge I needed, she taught me how to approach questions in a way I never knew, how to
                study the material, developed personalized plans for me, drilled me, and scheduled me to take practice
                tests strategically that would prepare and desensitize me to the fear and pressure that loomed around
                test day for me. My immense fear, self-doubt, and feelings of inadequacy were eating at me every day,
                and throughout it all she believed in me and pushed me. She cared for me as her own daughter, and told
                me I could persevere through this from day one. Dr. Le Pava knew when I was ready to take the exam
                because she recognized when my confidence was built, when my thinking process was clear, and when I was
                able to concentrate fully on myself. I was able to succeed with her help. I went from a 381 to a 613, a
                232 point increase--something that I thought was IMPOSSIBLE. Every time I talk about these dark times,
                I can't speak of them without my heart being overcome in appreciation for Dr. Le Pava. She was and is
                like a mother to me. She revived me and taught me how to prove myself through COMLEX, and I have the
                opportunity to become a doctor today because of her."
