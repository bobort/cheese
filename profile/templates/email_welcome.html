<p>Dear {{ user }}:</p>
<p>
    Thank you so much for choosing Ocean Ink for your tutoring and studying needs.
    If you have any questions about our services, please let us know. Tutoring services
    are conducted by members of our tutoring staff.
</p>
<p>
    Please check out our <a href="https://oceanink.net{% url 'frontend:schedule' %}">schedule</a> to view our free
    sessions that you will definitely want to be a part of. We teach students how to apply
    their knowledge by doing questions in our Morning Cute session. You do not have to
    be physically present to attend a session; they are accessible via <a href="http://zoom.us">Zoom</a>.
    We also have a drilling session in the evening hosted by Dr. Misbah Gill.
</p>
<p>
    Zoom requires an ID to be utilized. In order to retrieve that ID for each session, please sign in
    to the <a href="https://oceanink.net">website</a>. There will be a link to the Zoom meeting in a
    blue bar under the menu that you can click on. The ID is available about ten minutes prior to each
    session. If there are problems during a Zoom session, please check out our
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/oceanink1">Facebook</a> page.
</p>
<p>
    Please let us know if you would like to make any appointments. Pricing is available on the
    <a href="https://oceanink.net{% url 'profile:pay' %}">website</a>. Our physical location is in Champaign, Illinois, but
    we utilize the Internet to access any location you may be in.
</p>
<p>
    We are so happy to have you register with OI.  We love to support all of our students wherever they are.
    We hope together we make a better life for everyone.

<p>
Best wishes,<br>
Ocean Ink Staff
